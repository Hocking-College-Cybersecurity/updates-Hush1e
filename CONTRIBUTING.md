# Contributing to the Student Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is designed for students to manage and update their portfolios throughout the program. All updates are made via Pull Requests (PRs).

## How to Submit or Update Your Portfolio

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment to create your own copy of this repository.
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch.
   - Fill out the PR template with your name, bio, and any other requested info.
   - The automation will update the necessary files and create your portfolio page.

2. **Add a Completed Course or Project:**
   - Open a new PR in your repository.
   - Fill out the relevant section in the PR template (course or project info).
   - The automation will update your portfolio with the new course or project.

3. **Review and Merge:**
   - Wait for the automated checks to complete.
   - Once checks pass, your instructor will review and merge your PR.

## Tips
- Always use the PR template for updates.
- You can preview your portfolio locally using Jekyll if you wish.
- If you have questions, ask your instructor or open an issue.
