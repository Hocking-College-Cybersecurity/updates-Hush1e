# Student Portfolio Guide

Welcome to your portfolio repository! This README explains how you will add work to your portfolio using GitHub Classroom.

## Important Note

- **Access your portfolio only when instructed:** You should update your portfolio repository **only** when your instructor tells you to, typically at the end of the course for your final project.
- **Do not access or modify your portfolio repo outside of GitHub Classroom** until you have learned more about GitHub.

## How Portfolio Updates Work

1. **Initial Setup and All Entries**
    - All setup and additions to your portfolio will be done inside GitHub Classroom assignments.
    - You do **not** need to clone, push, or manage your portfolio repo on your own.

2. **Final Project Submission**
    - When your final project is due, your instructor will provide instructions for updating your portfolio.
    - Follow the steps in the GitHub Classroom assignment to add your final project.
